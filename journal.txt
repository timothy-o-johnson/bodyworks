did much research into how javascript handles objects in the context of passing, copying, and comparison

it took us 30 min

but we have ensured that in the prophase of mitosis,  each chromosome is composed of two chromatids connected by a centromere.
*** notes / thoughts ***
- it's clear we are going to have to organize this code better
- didn't really 'connect' the two chromatids so much as recognize that they must exist in proportion to each other
- debating how helpful/readible this line is
'let chromosomes = (cellAfterProphase.organelles.chromosomes = [])'  
the goal is to quickly and simply work with chromosomes property, but perhaps two lines may be better.  
- a little concerned about pass by value vs pass by reference may come back to bite us
- after we model mitosis to our satisfaction, we are open to the idea that this project is beyond our resources and may look to join a team that's already 
- and finally if anyone has any suggestions, please share!
