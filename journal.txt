not particularly pleased with how we handled today's test but we are glad that we did something.
don't like that it's descriptive rather than quantitative

thinking we should go back to coloring this stuff rather than coding it-- oy

finished enterProphase. 
o didn't really model the location of centromeres in cellAfterProphase
o inconsistent handling of counts (sometimes an organelle has a count property, sometimes the property is the count)
o not sure how to model this: 'D. each chromatid should have the equivalent amount of DNA of a chromosome'
-- learned that centromere is a region on a chromatid where the kinetochores assemble

did much research into how javascript handles objects in the context of passing, copying, and comparison

it took us 30 min 
ðŸ˜…
but we have ensured that in the prophase of mitosis,  each chromosome is composed of two chromatids connected by a centromere.

*** notes / thoughts ***
o it's clear we are going to have to organize this code better
o didn't really 'connect' the two chromatids so much as recognize that they must exist in proportion to each other
- debating how helpful/readible this line is
'let chromosomes = (cellAfterProphase.organelles.chromosomes = [])'  
the goal is to quickly and simply work with chromosomes property, but perhaps two lines may be better.  
- a little concerned about pass by value vs pass by reference may come back to bite us
- after we model mitosis to our satisfaction, we are open to the idea that this project is beyond our resources and may look to join a team that's already 
- and finally if anyone has any suggestions, please share!
